A project in one of my ECE classes to model a simple processor architecture in Verilog and have it run on a Nexys 4DDR FPGA Board.

I only uploaded the source files seperately, as Vivado's file structure would have made this more complicated than it should be.

Looking back at this, there are a lot of file/code redundency that were made. Probably due to the project being over a school quarter and building up on smaller projects over that time.
